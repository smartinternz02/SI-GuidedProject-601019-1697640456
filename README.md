Project : Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction For Loan Approval


Description: Banks worldwide rely on the credit system, a crucial factor for a country's economy. Credit risk evaluation is essential, and predicting loan defaulters is challenging but vital for minimizing losses. Machine Learning techniques, 
including Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost, are employed to forecast and manage credit risk. The study focuses on training and testing data with these algorithms, selecting the best model, and integrating it into Flask for IBM deployment.

Table of contents: 
1.) Flask: This file has the flask code needed to run the code on a web browser, it provides the user an interface to interact with and get a result of his/her approval for a loan
2.) ideationn_phase : In this Ideation phase need to work on the Empathy Map and the Brainstroming Map which helps in understanding the project and the set solution requirements. the file has a pdf of both.
3.) project_design_phase: In this project design phase we work on the Proposed solution, Solution Architecture & Determine the Requirements (Data Flow Diagram) as per the templates.
