# Project : Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction For Loan Approval


## Description: Banks worldwide rely on the credit system, a crucial factor for a country's economy. Credit risk evaluation is essential, and predicting loan defaulters is challenging but vital for minimizing losses. Machine Learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost, are employed to forecast and manage credit risk. The study focuses on training and testing data with these algorithms, selecting the best model, and integrating it into Flask for IBM deployment.

### Table of contents: 


### 1.) Flask: 
This file has the flask code needed to run the code on a web browser, it provides the user an interface to interact with and get a result of his/her approval for a loan


### 2.) ideationn_phase : 
In this Ideation phase need to work on the Empathy Map and the Brainstroming Map which helps in understanding the project and the set solution requirements. the file has a pdf of both.


### 3.) project_design_phase: 
In this project design phase we work on the Proposed solution, Solution Architecture & Determine the Requirements (Data Flow Diagram) as per the templates.


### 4.) project_planning_phase : 
In this phase we work on the Technology Stack and Project Planning.


### 5.) project_manual_and_code :
In this file, we have added a file containing the code (project_manual_and_code/project_code_and_webdesign_code) for the project along with pdf explaining the process of develpment of the code (in project_manual_and_code/SmartLender_Project_Code.ipynb)


### 6.) project_video: 
Here we have uploaded the file which contains the link for a video about our project explained by my teammate.



### How to Install and Run the Project: 
To download the code for the project, simply download the files from 'project_manual_and_code/project_code_and_webdesign_code'. Then, load the files in files into a common folder. Next, run the app.py file. Now, go the web browser and write the localhost url (http://127.0.0.1:5000) to get the result.


###How to Use the Project:
